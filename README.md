Whitespace Programming Language Java-based SDK and RTE

"Watch This Space"...

Fully functional Runtime Environment and SDK for the Whitespace Programming Language.
Supporting Development of Whitespace code with edit/compile/debug facility, runtime environment, and also a web-based remote service to run Whitespace code on a server via a web application.

Very very silly.

Completely pointless, with no practical application at all... Or is there?..

Because WPL reverses the traditional "strip whitespace at compile time" directive and uses **only** whitespace values as tokens, it would be **possible** to encode a full program between the lines of text in a file, or even a plain-text email...

This project has merit both as an intellectual exercise (in programming generally and also java programming) but also is a **really** good way of embedding thoroughly offensive text between the lines.

The thoroughly offensive emails was the driving force for this development.

SO having been introduced to this rare and beautiful language on 23/04 I spent a couple of days fuelled mainly by alcohol, nicotine and caffeine - in that order. My staple diet BTW - and produced this textbook example of late-night drunken-coding.

Oh dear. What a sad sad man.
BTW this is all Swav's fault. He should never have sent me the Whitespace link. Thanks Swav.
